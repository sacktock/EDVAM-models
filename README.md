# EDVAM: models

This project was completed as part of my summer research job at the "School of Engineering and Computing Sciences, Durham University" in the summer of 2021. I was tasked with leading my own research on 3D visual attention prediction in virual reality (VR) worlds. I implemented different recurrent neural network architectures and trained them to model visual attention using the EDVAM dataset.

## About

This research follows on from the previous work conducted by the authors of the EDVAM dataset. Please look at their [[GitHub]](https://github.com/YunzhanZHOU/EDVAM) and refer to their most recent [[Paper]]() for details about the data collection and format.
